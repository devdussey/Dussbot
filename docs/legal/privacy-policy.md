# Disphoria Bot Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 14, 2026  
Last updated: February 14, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how the Disphoria Discord bot ("Bot") collects, uses, stores, and shares information.

## 1. Operator

Data controller/operator: **[INSERT LEGAL NAME OR ORGANIZATION]**

Contact:
- Support server: https://discord.gg/d83rZnXETm
- Email: **[INSERT SUPPORT EMAIL]**

## 2. Information We Process

Depending on enabled features, the Bot may process:

- Discord identifiers: user IDs, guild IDs, channel IDs, role IDs, message IDs.
- Account metadata from Discord: usernames/tags, display names, avatars.
- Message content and basic message metadata for features such as analytics, moderation, leaderboards, and AI tooling.
- Join/leave and moderation-related event data (for logs and audit features).
- Economy and game data (for example balances, counters, and feature state).
- Configuration data set by server administrators.
- Media metadata and URLs for commands that process images/audio.
- Premium/usage status (for feature gating or daily limits).

## 3. Sources of Data

We receive data from:
- Discord interactions, events, and message content available to the Bot in servers where it is installed.
- Users who invoke commands and provide prompts, attachments, or links.
- Server administrators who configure the Bot.

## 4. Why We Process Data

We process data to:
- Provide Bot functionality and command responses.
- Operate moderation, logging, automation, and server management features.
- Support AI features requested by users/admins.
- Maintain uptime, reliability, abuse prevention, and security.

## 5. AI and Third-Party Processing

If enabled by the Operator/server configuration, certain data is sent to third-party processors:

- OpenAI: used for `/chat`, `/analysis`, `/summarize`, `/transcribe`, and optional AI-assisted moderation.
- remove.bg: used for `/removebg` image processing.
- Other optional providers configured by the Operator (for example image/AI providers).

Only data needed to perform the requested feature is sent.
You should not submit sensitive personal data unless necessary.

## 6. Data Retention

Retention varies by feature and configuration. By default in this codebase:

- Message analysis history is capped to recent entries per user (up to 1,000 stored messages per user per guild).
- Join/leave event history is capped (up to 10,000 recent events per guild).
- Some usage counters reset daily (for example free daily remove-background usage tracking).
- Other settings/log records are retained until overwritten, removed by admin action, or manually deleted by the Operator.

Data may also remain in Discord logs and third-party processor systems subject to their policies.

## 7. Legal Bases (Where Applicable)

Where required by law, we process data under one or more of:
- Legitimate interests (operating, securing, and improving the Bot).
- Performance of a contract (providing requested Bot features).
- Consent (where requested or required).
- Legal obligations.

## 8. Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell personal data.
We may share data:
- With service providers needed to operate requested features.
- When required by law, legal process, or valid authority request.
- To enforce rights, prevent fraud/abuse, or protect users and communities.

## 9. Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No method of storage or transmission is completely secure.

## 10. International Transfers

Data may be processed in countries other than your own depending on hosting location and third-party providers.

## 11. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of personal data.

How to request deletion or access:
- Contact the Operator via support server or email listed above.
- Include your Discord user ID, server ID, and request details.

Server owners/admins can also remove the Bot to stop new data collection in their server.

## 12. Children's Privacy

The Bot is not directed to children under the minimum age required by Discord and applicable law.

## 13. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Bot after updates means you accept the revised policy.

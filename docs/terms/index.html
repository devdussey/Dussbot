      </ul>

      <h2>2. Eligibility and Authority</h2>
      <p>You must comply with Discord's Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and all applicable laws. If you add the Bot to a server, you represent that you have authority to do so and to configure its features for that server.</p>

      <h2>3. Service Description</h2>

        <li>Harass, abuse, threaten, or target others.</li>

        <li>Abuse rate limits, exploit bugs, or interfere with operation.</li>
        <li>Process unlawful, infringing, or prohibited content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may restrict or terminate access for misuse, abuse, or safety reasons.</p>

      <h2>5. Server Administrator Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>Server owners/admins are responsible for:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Informing members that bot-based logging/automation is enabled.</li>
        <li>Using moderation and AI outputs with human judgment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h2>8. Paid or Premium Features</h2>
      <p>If premium features are offered, any pricing, duration, or access rules shown by the Bot or Operator apply. Unless required by law, fees are non-refundable once access is granted.</p>

      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Operator is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of data, profits, or goodwill arising from use of the Bot.</p>

      <h2>11. Suspension and Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Bot at any time, with or without notice, including for security, legal, operational, or abuse-prevention reasons. You may stop using the Bot at any time by removing it from your server.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Bot after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
